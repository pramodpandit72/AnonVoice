🧠 How You Handle “Government Won’t Know Who Posted”

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT for interviews

You should say this 👇 (exact wording you can use):

“The platform ensures user anonymity at the application level.
Emails are stored securely for authentication only and never exposed publicly.
The platform does not claim legal immunity but focuses on privacy-first design.”
