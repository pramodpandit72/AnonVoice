Hii 👋
This is actually a strong idea for a MERN CV project—if you frame it correctly and keep it ethical + legal. Let’s turn it into something impressive, safe, and interview-ready 🚀

🔥 Project Idea (CV-Ready)
Project Name: AnonVoice

An anonymous social platform for expressing opinions without fear.

🎯 Core Concept (What interviewers should understand)

A fully anonymous social media platform where users can:

Register using email (for authentication only)

Post opinions anonymously

Like, dislike, repost, and share posts

Remain untraceable to other users

Platform does not display real identity publicly

⚠️ Important framing:
You are NOT hiding criminals.
You are building privacy-first communication, similar to Reddit / Blind / NGL.

🧠 Key Features (Exactly What You Asked For)
👤 Authentication

Email + password signup

Email verification (optional but 🔥 for CV)

No public profile info (no name, no bio)

🕵️‍♂️ Anonymity Layer

Each user gets:

Random generated username (e.g., user_9xA21)

Email is never exposed

User IDs are hashed internally

📝 Posts

Text-based posts (later you can add images)

Categories:

Politics

Government policies

Education

Social issues

Timestamp

Anonymous author tag only

👍 Engagement System

Each post supports:

Like

Dislike

Repost

Share (copy link / social preview)

🔁 Repost System

Reposting keeps original content

Shows repost count

Credits original post (but still anonymous)

🛡️ Safety & Moderation (VERY IMPORTANT)

Report post option

Auto profanity filter

Admin dashboard (for moderation)

🧱 Tech Stack (MERN)
Frontend (React)

React + Vite

Tailwind CSS

Axios

JWT handling

Infinite scroll feed

Backend (Node + Express)

REST API

JWT authentication

Rate limiting (avoid spam)

Content moderation logic

Database (MongoDB)

Key Collections:

Users
Posts
Reactions
Reposts
Reports

Security

Password hashing (bcrypt)

JWT tokens

Helmet + CORS

IP masking logic (optional advanced feature)



🗂️ Database Design (Interview Gold)
User Schema
{
  _id,
  email,
  passwordHash,
  anonymousUsername,
  createdAt
}

Post Schema
{
  _id,
  content,
  authorId,
  likes,
  dislikes,
  comment,
  repostCount,
  createdAt
}

Reaction Schema
{
  userId,
  postId,
  type: "like" | "dislike"
}



--> The Frontend should look professional like reddit website 
with light and dark mode toggle button on navbar use https://fontawesome.com/
